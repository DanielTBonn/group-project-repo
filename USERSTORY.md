# USER STORY

AS a story creator
I WANT to use unique faces/names
So THAT I can create a character with an interesting background

## Acceptance Criteria 

GIVEN a randomly generated face and name
WHEN i wish to generate a new face/name
THEN i can click a randomize button to regenerate either one
WHEN i want to create a unique backstory for this character
THEN i can add a summary for the character to the page
WHEN i want to save my character for later
THEN i click a save button and all of the info is saved to localstorage
WHEN i want to view the past characters that i have created
THEN i can navigate to a page that stores all of the different characters and open their character page

## Notes

I think this should cover all of our bases for a minimum viable project. This project:
* Will use materializecss as a css framework instead of bootstrap
* Is already deployed to github pages
* Will be interactive by responding to user input to regenerate and accepting user input as the character's stories
* Uses 2 server-side apis (thispersondoesnotexist and namefake api)
* We'll use modals or some type of form elements if we need to
* Will save to client-side storage via localStorage
* Will be responsive (?)
* We'll be able to polish the UI since the basic project shouldn't take too long to finish
* Repository looking good
* We'll write a good README

One of the requirements for this project was writing up a USERSTORY so we got that out of the way. This seems like a good place to start
